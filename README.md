## Usage
The Reactor is easy and intuitive to use. To run the Reactor you'll just need to type `node index.js` in your terminal and hit `return`. Remember to be inside the README Reactor folder. After that, you'll ride in automatic; just answer the questions and hit `return` after each answer.

At the end, you'll receive a message confirming that your README is now ready. The file will be generated inside a new direction (folder) called `AwesomeREADME`.

If you need help opening the terminal read **[this guide](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/open-or-quit-terminal-apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac#:~:text=Terminal%20for%20me-,Open%20Terminal,%2C%20then%20double%2Dclick%20Terminal.)**.
